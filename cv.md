## About Me:
Hello, my name is Dmitriy! I am a frontend developer from Belarus!<br/> <br/>
Looking for a great team, where I will be able to realize my potential and apply my skills. <br/> I know how to organize myself well, as well as my workplace. I easily make friends with new people and communicate well with my teammates. I also know how to admit and, of course, correct my mistakes.
Also, I can easily learn and adapt to new tasks. If the project uses a technology that I am not familiar with / poorly familiar with, then I will familiarize myself with it as soon as possible and will be ready to work with it.<br/> <br/> At the moment, my main goal is to get a job as a Junior front-end developer. My strengths are purposefulness, perseverance and the desire to progress!
